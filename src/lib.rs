//! # Rustea
//!
//! `rustea` is a small crate for easily creating cross-platform TUI applications.
//! It is based off of the original [go-tea](https://github.com/tj/go-tea) created by TJ Holowaychuk.

/// Any boxed type that may or may not contain data.
/// They are fed to your applications `update` method to tell it how and what to update.
///
/// Typically, you will use the `downcast_ref` method on your messages to determine the type of the message,
/// and extract the data from them if present.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// // the type of your message
/// struct HttpResponse(String);
///
/// // the boxed message itself
/// let http_response_message = Box::new(HttpResponse("Hello World".to_string()));
///
/// // determining the type of your message, and extracting the response
/// if let Some(res) = http_response_message.downcast_ref::<HttpResponse>() {
///     // do something with the response
///     // for example, setting it in the model to be rendered
///     model.response = Some(res);
/// }
/// ```
pub type Message = Box<dyn Any + Send>;

/// A boxed function or closure that performs computations and optionally dispatches messages.
/// All commands are processed in their own threads, so blocking commands are totally fine.
/// Frequently, data needs to be passed to commands. Since commands take no arguments,
/// a common solution to this is to build constructor functions.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// // a constructor function
/// fn make_request_command(url: &str) -> Command {
///     // it's okay to block since commands are multi threaded
///     let text_response = reqwest::blocking::get(url).unwrap().text().unwrap();
///     
///     // the command itself
///     Box::new(move || Some(Box::new(HttpResponse(text_response))))

/// The trait your model must implement in order to be `run`.
///
/// `init` is called once when the model is run for the first time, and optionally returns a `Command`.
/// There is a default implementation of `init` that returns `None`.
///
/// `update` is called every time your application recieves a `Message`.
/// You are allowed to mutate your model's state in this function.
/// It optionally returns a `Command`.
///
/// `view` is called after every `update` and is responsible for rendering the model.
/// It returns a `String` that is printed to the screen.
/// You are _not_ allowed to mutate the state of your application in the view, only render it.
///
/// For examples, check the `examples` directory.

/// This will begin listening for keyboard events, and dispatching them to your application.
/// These keyboard events are handled by `crossterm`, and are fed into your `update` function as `Message`s.
/// You can access these keyboard events by simply downcasting them into a `crossterm::event::KeyEvent`.
///
/// `rustea` exports `crossterm`, so you can simply access it with `use rustea::crossterm`.
